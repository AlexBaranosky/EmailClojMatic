Next Steps
=============================================

* regression test / root cause analyze the deployment bug from the weak ol testing I did
  in core.clj (facts) of the different error email dispersal stuff

* investigate but where new version of seq-of-seqs? caused the application to crah with no error message either

* QA style testing of recent (past few weeks) features

* add link to the uberjar on wiki - see: http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/downloads/
