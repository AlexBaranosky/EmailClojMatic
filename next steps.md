Next Steps
=============================================

* put all config stuff into a config file that's accessed a function from Coojure code -- this config file will be in clojure data format, or property file format, and will not be committed to the repo.

* add sensible and clear error message, in some form, perhaps email, if you use the EmailClojMatic with a) no config file, or with b) an illformed one.

* add email warning when EmailClojMatic finds an unparsable entry in the reminders.txt

*

* add link to the uberjar on wiki

* fix it so that the directory to resources isn't hardcoded

* clean up 'setup' section of README
