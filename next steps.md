Next Steps
=============================================

* fix bug: when type `On 11/6/11 "msg" notify 8 days in advance` crashes, freezing, sending no email error message out.  Note that it was mis-formatted, should have been 11/6/2011 ...

* regression test / root cause analyze the deployment bug from the weak ol testing I did
  in core.clj (facts) of the different error email dispersal stuff

* investigate but where new version of seq-of-seqs? caused the application to crah with no error message either

* add link to the uberjar on wiki - see: http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/downloads/
