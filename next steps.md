Next Steps
=============================================

* put all config stuff into a config file that's accessed a function from Coojure code -- this config file will be in clojure data format, or property file format, and will not be committed to the repo.

* add link to the uberjar on wiki

* fix it so that the directory to resources isn't hardcoded

* clean up 'setup' section of README
