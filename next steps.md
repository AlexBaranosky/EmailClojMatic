Next Steps
=============================================

* share with others, spiff up github home page
* make the recpients be command line args to the jar - and for the reminders.bat
* put paths to files in config file, stop using fs/cwd since it fails when you run the batch file from other places than the folder it resides in
* somehow encapsulate the sequence of date-time sequences concept???
